## Known issues

* may be slow on really large spreadsheets (>100x100)

## TODO (random order)

* mobile browsers support
* scripting (aka "functions")
* cut/copy/paste multiple cells/columns/rows
* cells, linked with other spreadsheets
* lists (in form of just links to other spreadsheets)
* consider users' auth
* private spreadsheets
* password protect (preferably the way even server owner can't access user data)
* block/clone spreadsheet
* multiple users collaboration
* cells' styling
* context actions panel
* embedding (?)
* sync user session (pointer and stuff) with server (?)
* optimize CPU, memory and traffic usage
* fix all code imperfections
* consider RLE compression for data (see ODS format)
* i18n
* add/delete lines' and other animations (?)
* to perfect lines sizing (double click for optimal size, consider returning autogrowth)
* more spreadsheeting
* full xlsx compatibility (just a joke)
