# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore Byebug command history file.
.byebug_history

# Ignore shared directory content (see 'config/puma.rb').
/shared/log/*
!/shared/log/.keep
/shared/pids/*
!/shared/pids/.keep
/shared/sockets/*
!/shared/sockets/.keep

/dev
